#SoundUp

An Android app that will put the system volume to maximum when the screen is turned off.
My use case was that I often mute the sound on my tablet when using it. I would often get Skype calls 
when I was not near my tablet. Because the sound had been muted, I could not hear the notification.
By setting the volume to maximum when the screen is turned off, I ensure that I will always be able to hear the notification, even if
I forget to unmute the system volume.
